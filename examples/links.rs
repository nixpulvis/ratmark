//! Writes each link's address into the cells the view draws, with the
//! `links` feature, so backends that support it draw real links. The
//! crossterm backend prints them as OSC 8 links, which most terminals make
//! clickable.
//!
//!     cargo run --example links --features links
//!
//! The feature needs Ratatui's cell extensions, which aren't released yet
//! (ratatui/ratatui#2854), so this crate uses ratatui-core from that branch,
//! and an app using it needs a backend from the same branch with the
//! `cell-extensions` feature, like ratatui-crossterm here.
