//! Writes each link's address into the cells the view draws, with the
//! `native-links` feature, so backends that support it draw real links.
//! This prints them as OSC 8 links, which most terminals make clickable.
//!
//!     cargo run --example native_links --features native-links
//!
//! The feature needs Ratatui's cell extensions, which aren't released yet
//! (ratatui/ratatui#2854), so an app using it has to patch in the same
//! ratatui-core as this crate's Cargo.toml.
