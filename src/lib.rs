//! Render Markdown into [Ratatui] text.
//!
//! [`MarkdownView`] is a widget that shows a document, scrolled, with links
//! that can be focused from the keyboard or found under a click. Its
//! [`MarkdownState`] holds the document and lays it out again whenever the
//! width changes.
//!
//! Underneath, [`Rendered::render`] lays a document out for a given width
//! and returns its lines along with where each link landed, for drawing it
//! some other way.
//!
//! ```
//! let rendered = ratmark::Rendered::render("# Hi\n\nSee [the docs](https://docs.rs).", 40, &ratmark::Theme::default());
//! assert_eq!(rendered.links[0].url, "https://docs.rs");
//! ```
//!
//! CommonMark plus tables, footnotes, strikethrough, task lists and math are
//! supported. With the `html` feature, HTML embedded in the Markdown is read
//! for its text, links and simple formatting, and without it HTML is left
//! out. Code blocks are syntax highlighted with the `syntax`
//! feature, which is off by default. Code too wide for the page is cut off
//! rather than wrapped, and [`MarkdownState::shift_by`] and
//! [`MarkdownState::shift_at`] shift a block sideways.
//!
//! The `front-matter` feature, off by default, splits YAML or TOML front
//! matter off the top of a document instead of rendering it. See
//! [`front_matter`].
//!
//! The `kramdown` feature, also off by default, understands a few habits of
//! Markdown written for kramdown, Jekyll's default: attribute lists like
//! `{:.no_toc}` are dropped, `{:toc}` lists become tables of contents, and
//! Markdown inside `markdown="1"` elements is rendered as Markdown.
//!
//! The `native-links` feature, off by default, writes each link's URL into
//! the cells [`MarkdownView`] draws, so backends that support it show links
//! the terminal or browser knows about. See [`MarkdownState::with_base`].
//!
